NAME
       listadmin - process messages held by Mailman for approval

SYNOPSIS
       listadmin [-?] [-V] [-f configfile] [-t minutes] [--mail] [--nomail]
       [{-a|-r} file] [--add-member address] [--remove-member address] [-l]
       [listname]

DESCRIPTION
       listadmin is a textual alternative to Mailman's WWW interface for
       administering mailing lists.

OPTIONS
       -f configfile
              Fetch list of mailing lists from configfile rather than the
              default (~/.listadmin.ini).

       -t minutes
              Stop processing after minutes has passed.  Mostly useful for
              completely automated configurations of listadmin.

       --mail Addresses added as subscribers will have nomail turned off.

       --nomail
              Addresses added as subscribers will have nomail turned on.

       -a file
              Add e-mail addresses listed in file (one address per line) to
              the subscriber list.  The welcome message is suppressed.

       --add-member address
              Add address to the subscriber list, works as above.

       -r file
              Remove e-mail addresses listed in file (one address per line)
              from the subscriber list.

       --remove-member address
              Remove address from the subscriber list.

       -l     Display the subscriber list.

       listname
              Only process the lists matching listname.  Specify a complete
              address, a substring or a regular expression.

       -? or --help
              Display short usage description.

       -V or --version
              Output version number.

CONFIGURATION SYNTAX
       The configuration file contains lines which can contain either a
       comment, a directive, or a mailing list address.

       A line can be continued by putting a backslash character at the end of
       the line.  Any leading whitespace on the following line is removed.

       Comments begin with the character # and extend to the end of line.
       Backslash continuation is not applied to comments.

       The argument to the directive can be put in double quotes to protect
       space characters.  Inside double quotes, \" can be used to include a
       literal double quote, and \\ for a literal backslash.

DIRECTIVES
       A directive affects all the mailing lists addresses which follow after
       it in the configuration file.  The directives are:

              username username
                     Specifies the username to use for authentication.  (Not
                     all Mailman servers require a username.)

              password password
                     Specifies the password to use for authentication.

              adminurl url
                     The URL for maintaining Mailman requests.  Some
                     substitutions are performed: (examples below refer to the
                     hypothetical list foo-devel@example.net)

                      {list} The local part of the list name, e.g., "foo-
                             devel".

                     {domain}
                             The domain part of the list name, e.g.,
                             "example.net".

                     {subdomain}
                             The first component of the domain part, e.g.,
                             "example".

              default action
                     Specifies the action to take when the user presses just
                     Return.  Available actions are:

                     approve
                             The message will be sent to all member of the
                             list.

                      reject Notify sender that the message was rejected.

                     discard
                             Throw message away, don't notify sender.

                      skip   Don't decide now, leave it for later.

                      none   Reset to no default action.

              action action
                     This action will be taken for all messages where none of
                     the other rules apply (e.g., spamlevel, discard_if_from
                     etc.), ie., whenever the user would have been asked what
                     to do.  The same actions as for default are available,
                     although reject isn't very useful.

              spamlevel number
                     This specifies the threshold for automatic discard of
                     suspected spam messages.  12 is unlikely to have false
                     positives.  No user confirmation is needed, so it is best
                     to play it safe.  Less than 5 is not recommended.

              spamheader header-name
                     The name of the header which contains the spam score.  It
                     is assumed that the score is encoded as a sequence of
                     characters, like "*****" for the value 5.  By default it
                     will look for all headers with names containing "spam"
                     and "score" or "level", and pick the highest score if
                     there is more than one. Setting the header-name to
                     default will restore this behaviour.

              not_spam_if_from pattern
                     If the message's From header matches the pattern, all
                     automatic actions will be cancelled and you will be asked
                     what action to take explicitly.  The pattern can use Perl
                     regexp syntax.  If enclosed in slashes, some modifiers
                     can be added, a typical example being /pattern/i to match
                     case-insensitively.

              not_spam_if_subject pattern
                     As above, but matches against the Subject header.

              discard_if_from pattern
                     If the message's From header matches the pattern, it will
                     be discarded automatically.

              discard_if_subject pattern
                     As above, but matches against the Subject header.

              discard_if_reason pattern
                     As above, but matches against Mailman's reason for
                     holding the message for approval.

              subscription_default action
                     Specifies the action to take when the user presses just
                     Return while processing subscriptions.  Available actions
                     are:

                      accept The new subscriber will be added.

                      reject Notify sender that s/he was not allowed to join
                             the list.

                      skip   Don't decide now, leave it for later.

                      none   Reset to no default action.

              subscription_action action
                     This action will be taken always for all new subscribers
                     in the relevant lists, no user interaction will take
                     place.  The same actions as for subscription_default are
                     available, although only skip is very useful.  It is
                     better to get automatic accept and reject behaviour by
                     changing the Mailman configuration.

              confirm yes|no
                     Before submitting changes, ask for confirmation.  Default
                     is "yes".

              unprintable questionmark|unicode
                     If the subject or sender address contains characters the
                     terminal can't display, they will be replaced by either
                     "<?>" (in questionmark mode, the default) or something
                     like "<U+86a8>" (in unicode mode).

              log filename
                     Changes submitted to the web interface are logged.  All
                     the changes for one list are sent in batches at the end
                     of processing.  The format in the log is first a line
                     containing the list name and a time stamp in local time.
                     Then one line for each message, in the format

                     action D:[date] F:[sender] S:[subject]

                     This batch of lines is terminated by a line saying
                     changes sent to server.

                     The same substitutions are performed on filename as on
                     the argument to adminurl.  Tilde syntax can be used to
                     refer to home directories.  The filename none turns off
                     logging.

              meta_member_support yes|no
                     Meta members are an experimental feature at the
                     University of Oslo.  This option is enabled by default
                     for lists in uio.no, and is needed to avoid clearing the
                     list of meta members when manipulating the list of
                     ordinary members.  Note: Requires additional Perl module
                     WWW::Mechanize

INTERACTIVE USE
       The user interface to listadmin is line oriented with single letter
       commands.  By pressing Return, the default action is chosen.  The
       default action is printed in brackets in the prompt.  The available
       actions are:

              a      Approve sending the message to all members of the list.

              r      Reject the message and notify sender of the decision.

              d      Discard the message silently, don't notify sender.

              s      Skip the message, leave its status as pending unchanged.

              b      View Body, display the first 20 lines of the message.

              f      View Full, display the complete message, including
                     headers.

              t      View Time, display the Date header from the message.

              number Jump forward or backward to message number.

              u      Go back to the previous message and undo the last
                     approve, discard or reject action.

              /pattern
                     Search (case-insensitively) for the next message with
                     matching From or Subject.  If pattern is left out, the
                     previous value will be used.

              ?pattern
                     As above, but backwards.

              .      Redisplay information about current message.

              add    Add address as subscriber to the list.  If address is
                     left out, use the sender of the current message.

              nomail As add, but adds address with "nomail" enabled.

              list   List subscriber addresses matching pattern, or the full
                     list if no pattern is specified.

              rem    Remove address from the subscriber list.  Note: there is
                     no undo for this action.

              q      Quit processing this list and go on to the next.

       Changes will not take effect until the end of the list has been
       reached.  At that time, the user will be prompted whether the changes
       should be submitted to Mailman (see also "confirm" directive above).

EXAMPLES
       To process only the lists of a single domain, specify the domain as the
       pattern:
          listadmin example.com

       To disable the printing of characters outside US-ASCII, set the locale
       appropriately:
          env LC_CTYPE=C listadmin

       An example configuration file:
          # A comment, it must appear on a line by itself.
          #
          # Settings affect all lists being listed after it.

          username jdoe@example.com
          password Geheim
          default discard
          # This one works for Sourceforge:
          adminurl http://{domain}/lists/admindb/{list}

          slartibartfast@lists.sourceforge.net

          # This is how the default Mailman URLs look:
          adminurl http://{domain}/mailman/admindb/{list}

          # If the password contains quotes or spaces, you may need
          # to put it in quotes.  A complex example:
          password "\"lise\\ "

          # These lists will still use the username [jdoe], but the
          # password is now ["lise\ ].

          default approve
          discard_if_reason "Message has implicit|Too many recipients"
          discard_if_from ^(postmaster|mailer(-daemon)?|listproc|no-reply)@

          foo-devel@example.net

          # No one should ever send e-mail to the next list, so throw it
          # all away, without asking any questions
          action discard
          confirm no
          foo-announce@example.net

ENVIRONMENT
       http_proxy or HTTP_PROXY
              Specifies a proxy to use for HTTP.

       https_proxy or HTTPS_PROXY
              Specifies a proxy to use for HTTPS.

       LC_CTYPE
              The character set support is deduced from this variable.

FILES
       $HOME/.listadmin.ini

       The default configuration file.

BUGS
       The HTML parser is quite fragile and depends on Mailman not to change
       the format of its generated code.

       An extra blank line is sometimes added to the subject when it contains
       double width characters (e.g. Chinese).  This is probably a bug in
       Text::Reform.
